Run commands in this documentation from the `clawd/` repository root unless a guide says otherwise. Use the Node version in `.node-version` and `npm ci`; the pnpm files under `reconstruction/` are historical records.

Current desktop and iOS captures: [screenshots](screenshots/README.md). Source publication remote: [github-readiness](github-readiness.md). Public website: [https://clawdbot.party](https://clawdbot.party). Solana Mobile: [https://clawdbot.party/mobile](https://clawdbot.party/mobile).

- [Current adaptation evidence](adaptation-status.md)

The local `install-status-2026-09-07.md` file is an ignored historical installation/incident record, when present. It is not required in a public source export and is not a current health report.
